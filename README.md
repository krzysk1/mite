Mooney M-18C Mite for X-Plane 11, by FTLX Designs

The Mooney M-18 Mite is a single-place, low-wing monoplane with retractable, tricycle landing gear. It is mainly of fabric-covered wood construction designed for the general aviation market and offering extremely low operating costs. The Mite was designed by Al Mooney and was intended as a personal airplane marketed to fighter pilots returning from World War II.

The aircraft featured a unique "safe-trim" system. This mechanical device links the wing flaps to the tail trim system and automatically adjusts the horizontal stabilizer angle when the flaps are deflected, reducing or eliminating pitch changes when the flaps are lowered.

Flying the Mooney Mite:
The Mite has the typical start sequence; battery, mixture and mags. This simulation implements a more "modern" gear warning system with annunciators; the original Mites used a unique Wig-wag warning device which waves from the instrument panel when the pilot throttles-back with the gear up.  I have also attempted to implement (via plug-in) the "safe-trim" system by slaving the flap control to the trim system, hopefully all the bugs are squashed.  Be advised that the fuel gauge is behind your right shoulder! Real owners will usually add a mirror in the front panel in order to make reading the gauge easier.

This model simulates the Continental A65 engine, yielding 65hp at 2300 rpm.  Type certificates for both the engine and airframe, as well as other soures were used for validating the accuracy of the model, it flies pretty close to the published numbers.  Flying characteristics are typical for an aircaft of its size and power; rotation is usually around 40-50mph, climb is roughly 80-85.  Approach will usually be between 70 and 80mph, with final around 60 for a touchdown between 45-50mph depending on weight.
